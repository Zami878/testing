!DOCTYPE html: This tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document. ,
<html>: The root element of the HTML page.,<head>: Contains meta information about the webpage (title, CSS, etc.).,
<body>: The content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links, goes here. --> 


    HTML Base Tag: If you have a base URL that is common to many images, you can use the <base> tag in your HTML file to set a base URL for all relative paths. For example:

    html
    Copy code
    <base href="https://example.com/images/">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">


    The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the
     image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, 
     or if the user uses a screen reader.

     The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
     
     The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

     ou should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.
         This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.<html lang="en">
            


The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 

Example
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>




HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

Example
<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>


 <bdo dir="rtl">Urdu h bhen ke lund</bdo> // reverse

 
 <h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
